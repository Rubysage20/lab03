Preheat Oven to 350 degrees. Butter and Flour two 9" cake pans. Prepare red velvet cake batter according to box instructions <br>

Divide batter among prepared cake pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (30 to 32 minutes). Let cool slightly in cake pans, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely. Using a serrated knife, level out tops of the cake so they're flat. <br><br>

In a large bowl using a hand mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat cream cheese and sugar until fluffy and combined, 3 minutes. Add eggs, one a time, until combined. Add sour cream, flour, vanilla, and salt and beat until combined.<br><br>
Step 4.<br>
		Pour filling into prepared springform pan and bake until only slightly jiggly in the center , about 1 hour. Let cool slightly, then transfer to the freezer to cool completely and firm up before assembling.<br><br>
Step 5.<br>
Make cream cheese frosting: In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy, then add powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until combined. <br><br>
Step 6. <br>
		Assemble Cake: On a cake platter, place on red velvet cake. Top with cheesecake layer, pressing down firmly, then top with second red velvet cake.<br><br>
Step 7. <br>
		Using an offset spatula, frost cake with cream cheese frosting. <br><br>
Step 8. <br>
		Garnish with red velvet cake crumbs before serving. <br></ol>
