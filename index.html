Preheat Oven to 350 degrees. Butter and Flour two 9" cake pans. Prepare red velvet cake batter according to box instructions <br>

Add eggs, one a time, until combined. Add sour cream, flour, vanilla, and salt and beat until combined.<br><br>
Step 4.<br>
		Pour filling into prepared springform pan and bake until only slightly jiggly in the center , about 1 hour. Let cool slightly, then transfer to the freezer to cool completely and firm up before assembling.<br><br>
Step 5.<br>
Make cream cheese frosting: In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy, then add powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until combined. <br><br>
Step 6. <br>
		Assemble Cake: On a cake platter, place on red velvet cake. Top with cheesecake layer, pressing down firmly, then top with second red velvet cake.<br><br>
Step 7. <br>
		Using an offset spatula, frost cake with cream cheese frosting. <br><br>
Step 8. <br>
